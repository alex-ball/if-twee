# Interactive Fiction using Twee2

This repository contains interactive fiction I have written using
[Twee2](https://avapoet.github.io/twee2/),
being a command-line version of [Twine 2](http://twinery.org/).
In all cases I would recommend playing the games before looking at the souce code.

## The Spectrap

This is an escape game aimed at young children, based around the theme of colours.
It is quite short and quite easy, with no nasty surprises.

Experienced gamers may notice the influence of such classics as
Graham Nelson's [*Curses!*](http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=plvzam05bmz3enh8) and
Adam Cadre's [*Photopia*](http://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=ju778uv5xaswnlpl),
even though this game is nothing at all like either of them.

  * You can [play it online](https://alexball.me.uk/if/spectrap/).
  * The source file is `spectrap.tw2`.
